## caseConversion.cpp instructions:
    Write a program that takes a character from terminal as input, and provide one of the following three outputs depending on the input character:

        - 2. Input is an upper-case letter from the English alphabet: The program should output the corresponding lower-case letter.
        - 3. Input is anything other than an upper or lower-case letter from the English alphabet: The program should echo the input character, i.e., output exactly the character that was input

## diamond.cpp instructions:
