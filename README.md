# Assignment 2 : Array Manipulation and Sorting Patient Records

## caseConversion.cpp instructions:
    Write a program that takes a character from terminal as input, and provide one of the following three outputs depending on the input character:
        - 1. Input is a lower-case letter from the English alphabet: The program should output the    corresponding upper-case letter.
        - 2. Input is an upper-case letter from the English alphabet: The program should output the corresponding lower-case letter.
        - 3. Input is anything other than an upper or lower-case letter from the English alphabet: The program should echo the input character, i.e., output exactly the character that was input

## diamond.cpp instructions:
    - 1) Write a program that asks for a positive integer input to determine the size of the diamond and print out the diamond accordingly.
    - 2) The diamond is created using forward (/) and backward slashes (\); the height and width of the diamond are twize the input size, i.e., a diamond of size 5 would have a height of 10 lines and a width of 10 characters.

## largeSum.cpp instructions:
    - 1) Write a program that takes two positive integer inputs as command-line arguments and outputs the sum of the two integers. For this program the inputs may be larger than can be stored in a native datatype.
    - 2) Test your completed program with various command line arguments. In particular, try these test cases:
    | Input 1                   |  Input 2                   |
    |:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
    | 1                         |  1                         |
    | 20                        |  95                        |
    | 2529382928                |  438283832                 |
    | 9999999999                |  1                         |
    | 9223372036854775808       |  9223372036854775808       |
    | 9223372036854775808       | 486127654835486515383218192|
    | 1486515347865138654821865 |  348621896435183186        |

    Note: Response file answering the inputs is called "largeSum response file".
